Proprietary software is too expensive for much of the world. Open Source is the answer.

## The Cost Barrier
In developing nations, licensing fees for major EHR systems can cost more than a clinic's entire annual budget. This forces doctors to use paper, leading to lost records and medication errors.

## The Ciyex Model
By making our core software **free and open source (AGPLv3)**, we empower:
*   **NGOs**: Direct resources to patient care, not software licenses.
*   **Startups**: Build innovative health apps on a solid foundation.
*   **Governments**: Own their national health infrastructure.

Software should save lives, not drain bank accounts.
