Telehealth is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity. Ciyex makes virtual visits seamless.

## One-Click Visits
Forget sending Zoom links via email. With Ciyex Telehealth (powered by Jitsi):
1.  Patient receives a secure SMS link.
2.  Doctor clicks "Start Visit" in the chart.
3.  Video window opens right next to the patient's notes.

## Integrated Workflow
Documenting a video visit shouldn't be hard.
*   **Side-by-Side Charting**: Type your SOAP note while seeing the patient.
*   **Screen Sharing**: Show patients their X-rays or lab results live.
*   **Secure**: End-to-end encrypted and HIPAA compliant.
