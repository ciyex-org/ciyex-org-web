Interoperability is the biggest challenge in healthcare IT. Here is how Ciyex uses HL7 FHIR to solve it.

<!-- truncate -->

## What is FHIR?
**Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)** is the global standard for exchanging healthcare data. It replaces older, clunky standards like HL7 v2 and CDA.

## Why it Matters
Without FHIR, your data is trapped. With FHIR:
*   **Patient Access**: Patients can connect their health data to apps like Apple Health.
*   **Lab Integration**: Seamlessly receive results from LabCorp and Quest.
*   **Referrals**: Send CCDs (Continuity of Care Documents) to specialists instantly.

Ciyex is **FHIR R4 native**. We don't just "support" FHIR; our database is built around it.
