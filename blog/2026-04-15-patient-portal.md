Engaged patients have better outcomes. The Ciyex Patient Portal puts them in the driver's seat.

<!-- truncate -->

## Self-Scheduling
No more phone tag. Patients can see your real-time availability and book appointments online.

## Medical Records Access
Under the 21st Century Cures Act, patients have a right to their data. The portal allows them to:
*   Download lab results.
*   View vaccination history.
*   Read clinical visit notes (OpenNotes).

## Secure Messaging
Patients can ask simple questions without an office visit. Messages are triaged by staff and routed to the provider if necessary, streamlining communication.
