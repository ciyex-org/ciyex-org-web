Want to write code that saves lives? Here is how to get started with Ciyex.

<!-- truncate -->

## Prerequisites
*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   Java 21
*   Node.js 20+

## Setting Up Your Environment
The easiest way is using our `docker-compose.dev.yml`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciyex-org/ciyex
cd ciyex
docker-compose up -d
```

This spins up Postgres, Keycloak, and the Spring Boot backend.
