# Introducing Ciyex EHR: The Future of Open Source Healthcare

<!-- truncate -->

Healthcare software has been stuck in the past for too long. Proprietary, expensive, and clunky EHRs have dominated the market, leaving doctors frustrated and patient data siloed.

**Ciyex EHR** changes that.

## Our Mission
We believe that **healthcare technology should be accessible to everyone**. Whether you are a small clinic in rural America or a large NGO operating in developing nations, you deserve world-class software to manage patient care.

## Why Open Source?
1.  **Transparency**: No hidden code. No hidden data collection.
2.  **Security**: Open code means more eyes on security vulnerabilities.
3.  **Ownership**: You own your data. You are not locked into a vendor.

## What's Next?
This is just the beginning (`v0.1.0`). We are building a community of developers, doctors, and designers to revolutionize healthcare software.
