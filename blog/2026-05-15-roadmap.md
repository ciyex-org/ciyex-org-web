What's next for Ciyex? Here is a sneak peek at our roadmap for 2027.

<!-- truncate -->

## AI Scribe 🤖
We are integrating LLMs (like GPT-4) to listen to patient visits and automatically draft SOAP notes. This can save providers 2 hours of documentation time per day.

## Population Health Analytics 📊
New dashboards to track chronic disease management across your entire patient panel. Identify gaps in care (e.g., missed diabetic eye exams) instantly.

## Mobile App 📱
A native iOS and Android app for patients to manage appointments and for providers to approve refill requests on the go.

The future is bright. Thank you for being part of the journey.
